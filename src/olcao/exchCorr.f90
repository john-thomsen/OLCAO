   ! Exchange Correlation mesh definition.
   integer :: printXCMesh ! 0 = Do not print the mesh; 1 = Print it.
   integer :: numSampleVectors ! How many vectors to use.
   real (kind=double), dimension (2) :: angSampleWeights ! This holds the
         !   weighting factor coefficients that are applied to the vectors.
         !   There are two weighting zones:  The region inside the covalent
         !   radius and the region outside the covalent radius (defined by the
         !   potential type definition).  Presently the default input uses the
         !   same factor for both regions and so the covalent radius has little
         !   meaning or use.  Testing should be applied though.
   real (kind=double), allocatable, dimension (:,:) :: angSampleVectors !
         !   The angular sample vectors are held here.  The first dimension
         !   holds the three space coordinates of the vectors, and the
         !   second dimension is the number of vectors.  Note that it is
         !   assumed that the vectors are already normalized to one in the
         !   input file and that no normalization will occur in the program.
   real (kind=double) :: rSampleIn  ! This is the radius that divides the
         !   inner range of a vector from the middle range of a vector.
   real (kind=double) :: rSampleOut ! This is the radius that divides the
         !   outer range of a vector from the middle range of a vector.
   real (kind=double) :: rSampleSpace ! This is the spacing of the sample
         !   points.

!   real (kind=double), allocatable, dimension (:,:) :: exchCorrOverlap
!   real (kind=double), allocatable, dimension (:,:) :: exchRhoOp
   integer :: numRayPoints    ! Number of ray points for a specific potential
                              !   site.  Also used to determine the max.
   integer :: maxNumRayPoints ! Max number of ray points of all the potential
                              !   sites in the system.

   ! A couple of intermediate data sets that are retained from the calculation
   !   of certain mesh parameters so that they don't have to be recalculated
   !   again when the actual mesh and overlap values are calculated.
   real (kind=double), allocatable, dimension (:,:) :: siteSampleMaxRadius !
         !   This stores the maximum distance for each angular sample
         !   vector for each potential site.
   real (kind=double), allocatable, dimension (:,:) :: potLatticeSep ! This
         !   set of vectors stored the difference between the current
         !   potential site and the lattice vector closest to it.
